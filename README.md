# PlantDiseaseClassifier

For training the model I have used google colab. I have used Pytorch library and used transfer learning approach to train the model. The model architecture used is ResNet.

You can download the trained model from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/18iNrfxMOXSAvnMG168pWrbkIkZ_ttUU2/view?usp=sharing)

After training and validating the model I have used flask framework to develop an API, once API I deployed it on the Heroku Webserver.
